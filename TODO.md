# TODO: Update Website Color Theme to Match Rainbow Logo

## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Update `app/globals.css` to set CSS variables to rainbow-inspired colors (e.g., primary as red, secondary as orange, etc.) for both light and dark modes.
- [x] Update `components/Header.tsx` to use theme colors (e.g., change bg-black to bg-primary) instead of hardcoded colors.
- [x] Run development server to test the new color theme and ensure it matches the rainbow logo.
- [x] Verify all components render correctly with the new theme.
